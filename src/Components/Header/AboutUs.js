                      The rise of LVNC as Lok Vishwas News leading news channel within a short span of its existence owes a lot to the vision of its chairman and editor-in-chief Chandrakant Kshirsagar and the dedication and toil of its ever-growing team of bright news channel professionals.

                    Chandrakant Kshirsagar co-founded India TV  in April, 2020 from a Gujrat , Surat.

                   LVNC  has created benchmarks in innovation, impact, ratings, time spends, and viewer-support. Indeed, lvnc's newsbreaks have inspired talk shows on rival channels, Bollywood films, BBC documentaries and articles in Time Magazine, even Amul hoardings.

                  In today's rampant me-too-ism, lvnc is, perhaps, the only Hindi news channel that is perceived as "courageous" and "different."

                   It is the result of Mr. Kshirsagar leading the way on the lonely path of "credibility first." It is the result of the efforts of a self-made man who kept both his feet firmly on the ground .
